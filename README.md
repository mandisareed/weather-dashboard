This app is mobile responsive, so it's great for when the user is on the go and needs to see weather conditions for any US city to plan their activities.
The motivation behind this app was to create something user friendly no matter the user's technology proficiency.

Future developments include updating how the date is displayed, adding more comprehensive styling elements, and storing the user's search history.
